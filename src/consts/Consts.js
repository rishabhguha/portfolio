The System gives you a set of flexible, generic wrapper components like Box and Container that can be quickly customized using the sx prop. This prop lets you define styles directly within the components themselves, rather than creating bulky and redundant const definitions with styled-components. It also gives you direct access to your theme's custom design tokens to ensure consistency in one-off styles. Learn more on the sx prop page."
